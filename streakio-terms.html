    <ul>
        <li><strong>Not a Medical Device:</strong> The app is not intended to diagnose, treat, or prevent any disease or medical condition.</li>
        <li><strong>Accuracy:</strong> Step count data is derived from your device's hardware sensors. We cannot guarantee 100% accuracy, as results may vary based on device manufacturer, sensor quality, and battery optimization settings.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Disclaimer of Warranties</h2>
    <p>The app is provided "as is" and "as available" without warranties of any kind, either express or implied. We do not guarantee that the app will be error-free, secure, or available at any particular time or location. </p>

    <h2>5. Limitation of Liability</h2>
    <p>In no event shall we be liable for any direct, indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages, including without limitation, loss of profits, data, use, goodwill, or other intangible losses, resulting from your access to or use of or inability to access or use the app.</p>

    <h2>6. Updates & Changes</h2>
    <p>We may wish to update the app at some point. The app is currently available on Android – the requirements for the system (and for any additional systems we decide to extend the availability of the app to) may change, and you’ll need to download the updates if you want to keep using the app.</p>

    <h2>7. Changes to Terms</h2>
    <p>We reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to modify or replace these Terms at any time. What constitutes a material change will be determined at our sole discretion. Continued use of the app constitutes acceptance of the new terms.</p>
